# üëÄ Do you want to see the demo of the project?
You don't need to run the Database management system. 
Just donwload the jar file and 2 of db files. 
Then you can execute the project. Because I used H2 databse for this project.
So the Database will execute in the memory.
`But note that you need that to db files in the same directory.`

## üèÉHow to execute the project
- I created jar file and H2 databse db file for the project in `ExecutableJarFileAndH2DatabseFiles` folder.
- Download the files in `ExecutableJarFileAndH2DatabseFiles`
- Execute the command below in CMD in the `ExecutableJarFileAndH2DatabseFiles` folder
